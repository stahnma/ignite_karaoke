# Ignite Karaoke Generator


The idea of this project is to grab pictures from Reddit and use them as the slides for ignite karaoke.

Thus far it grabs a few hundred photos, randomly grabs 20 and outputs it to stdout (html) which you can serve. That will change when I get time to include the web serving in this program.

# WIP

This is a total WIP and less good than even my normal junk :)
